      <p>Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
      <p><strong>Hello!</strong> Malee here. It's a pleasure to meet everyone. Here is a little about myself:
        <br>
            <ul>
                <br></br>
                <li>I was born somewhere between Laos and Thailand while my parents were en route to a refugee camp.</li>
                <li>I recently moved to Fresno, CA from Visalia, CA and I'm living with 2 dogs, Max and Mister.</li>

                <img src="images/mister1.jpg"/>
                <li>I'm studying computer science at FSU, but prior to this I was working full-time as a supervisor at a diode manufacturing company and attending community 
                    college part-time. My job included having to relay user feedback to programmers and digging through databases. Eventually, I started to make simple programs for
                    my team using Microsoft Access. It was my first exposure to coding and what ultimately lead me to pursue computer science as a career. I decided to take the leap 
                    and become a full-time student in the summer of 2020.
                </li>
                <li>I love dogs (and i'm also allergic to them).</li>
                <li>My favorite food is shrimp. I will eat any dish if it's included.</li>
                <li>Most of my coding experience is with c++, but I'm learning python and java as well. Feel free to view my <a href="https://github.com/MSeechan" target="_blank">github</a>.
                <li>Other than tinkering with code, I enjoy taking photos with my potato phone. I'll usually take photos of things I find interesting or humorous. See my gallery <a href="gallery.html">here!</a></li>
            </ul>
