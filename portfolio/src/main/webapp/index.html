        <p><strong>Hello!</strong> Malee here. It's a pleasure to meet everyone. Here is a little about myself:
            I'm studying computer science at FSU, but prior to this I was working full-time as a supervisor at a diode
            manufacturing company and attending community
            college part-time. My job included having to relay user feedback to programmers and digging through
            databases. Eventually, I started to make simple programs for
            my team using Microsoft Access. It was my first exposure to coding and what ultimately lead me to pursue
            computer science as a career. I decided to take the leap
            and become a full-time student in the summer of 2020. Most of my coding experience is with c++, but I'm
            learning python and java as well. Feel free to view my
            <a href="https://github.com/MSeechan" target="_blank">github</a>.Other than tinkering with code, I enjoy
            taking photos with my potato phone. I'll usually take photos
            of things I find interesting or humorous. See my gallery <a href="gallery.html">here!</a></p>
